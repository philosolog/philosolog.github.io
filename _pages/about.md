Hi! I'm a prospective undergraduate with an interest toward furthering my research experience in pure mathematics and computational neuroscience!

I currently enjoy competitive programming, helping others with all things academic, and nailing my eight daily Clash of Clans raids. ðŸ™„

**Here's a quick background to fill some space!**
- I started programming in elementary school in order to impress my friends and family with small game-design projects.

- Later, I'd discover my interest in pure math when my first precalculus teacher introduced to me the concept of a combinatorial magic square.

- Through random projects over the years, I began to build my tech stack.

- It wasn't until later that I started practicing programming in the context of competitive programming... and here I am now!
